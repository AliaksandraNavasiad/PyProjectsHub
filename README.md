# Basic Calculator (Version 01)

This is a simple **Python-based calculator** that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations interactively through the terminal.

## Features
- Supports four operations:
  1. Addition
  2. Subtraction
  3. Multiplication
  4. Division
- Handles division by zero gracefully with a friendly message.
- Allows users to perform multiple calculations in a single session.
- Provides input validation to ensure smooth user interaction.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local system.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook file (`basic_calculator.ipynb`) in any environment that supports Jupyter (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, VS Code).
3. Follow the prompts to:
   - Select an operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
   - Enter the numbers you’d like to calculate.
   - Perform as many calculations as you'd like in the same session.

## Example Usage
Here’s an example interaction:

Select the operation you'd like to perform (choose number, e.g.: 1): 1. add 2. subtract 3. multiply 4. divide
Enter an operation (1, 2, 3, or 4): 4 Enter the first number (a): 4 Enter the second number (b): 0 Result of Division: Division by zero is not possible. Please try again.
Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): yes

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Future Improvements
- Add more advanced operations (e.g., exponentiation, square roots).
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved usability.
- Integrate with external libraries like NumPy for extended functionality.
